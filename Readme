Hey ! This is a basic CRUD application file built with framework Flask with NRDBMS database mongoDB.


This Crud API collection Includes


1 ) Create new object
2 ) Get all objects
3 ) Get objects by id 
    - get objects using parameter
4 ) Upload Pictures
5 ) Update objects
6 ) Delete Object


I had a few issues with 3 - c : that's why I have tried to do it with a specific field which will, although limit the use of fields of objects so it's kind of a demerit
